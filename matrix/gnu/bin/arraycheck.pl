# Arrays in Perl contain an ordered list of values that can be accessed
# using built-in functions. They are one of the most useful data structures
# and frequently used in Perl programming.

# <h2>Creating an array<h2>
# In Perl variables are identified using vigils. Arrays use @ (as in ‘a’ for array),
# so the format is: @any_name_you_choose_here. Arrays are initialised by assigning a
# list of values (comma separated values between parentheses). Unlike more formal
# languages, Perl arrays can contain a mix of numbers, strings, objects and references.

# version 1.0
sub version  {
    my $self = @INC; # themes select style material
    my $Parser = $self->{"material"};
    my $version = $Parser;
    return $self->$version;

    my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    my @keyboard = ["pt-br/en"];
    my @random_collect = (@bracket_money_array,@keyboard);
}

# Finding the array length / size
# The length of an array (aka the ‘size’) is the count of the number of elements
# in the array. To find the array length, use the array in a scalar context:
sub find_array_length_size  {
    my @running_ambient_start = @INC;
    my @ice9 = @running_ambient_start->{"send-power"};
    my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4);
    my @array_length = @numbers;
    return 0;
}

# Accessing array elements directly
# Arrays can be accessed in a variety of ways: by directly accessing an element,
# slicing a group of elements or looping through the entire array, accessing one element at a time.
# When directly accessing an array element, use the array name prefaced with the scalar
# sigill ($) instead of (@) and the index number of the element enclosed in square brackets.
# Arrays are zero-based, which means that the first element’s index number is 0 (not 1!).

sub accessed_array_elements_directly  {
    my @self = @INC;
    my @type = @self->find_array_length_size($$,$$) if $1; # magic body one static operation nuclear
    my @loop = @type->{"github"};
    my @gits = @loop->find_array_length_size($$,$$) if $1; # magic body of compact headers print input and output
    my @puts = @self->("current, values, money"); # current and value in money produced nuclear stability

}

# The implication of zero-based indexing is that the index number of the last element in an array is equal
# to the length of the array minus one.

sub index_array_numbers_elements  {
    my @numbers = [11, 64, 29, 22, 100];
    my $numbers_array_length = @numbers;
    my $numbers_elements = $numbers_array_length - 1;
    # there for loop nuclear position packages and production in monet free life easy
    return 0;
}
# For simpler ways to access the last element of an array
# - see our recent article for examples.

# Loop through an array with foreach
# Arrays elements can be accessed sequentially using a foreach loop to iterate
# through the array one element at a time.

sub loop_array_accessed  {
    my @names_array_start = ["split", "apples", "apricot", "cherry", "fig", "guava",
    "mellon", "orange", "grape", "strawberry", "mango", "passion-fruits"];
    print @names_array_start;
    return 0;
}

# Other common functions for looping through arrays are grep and map.

# shift, un shift, push and pop
# Perl arrays are dynamic in length, which means that elements can be added
# to and removed from the array as required. Perl provides four functions
# for this: shift, un shift, push and pop.

# shift removes and returns the first element from the array, reducing
# the array length by 1.

sub common_arrays_through  {
    my @adjust = ["pop", "array", "push", "shift", "perl", "provides"];
    my @calculation = shift @adjust;
    print @adjust;
}

# If no array is passed to shift, it will operate on @_. This makes it useful
# in subroutines and methods where by default @_ contains the arguments from
# the subroutine / method call. E.G.:

sub array_length_adjust {
    my $callers_names = shift;
    print $callers_names;
}

# The other three array functions work similarly to shift. un shift receives and inserts
# a new element into the front of the array increasing the array length by 1.push receives
# and inserts a new element to the end of the array, increasing the array length by 1.
# pop removes and returns the last element in the array, reducing the array length by 1.

sub array_elements_inserts {
    my @elements_inserts = ["array", "works", "news", "length", "last", "inserts"];
    my @elements_call = @elements_inserts;
    print @elements_call;

    my @elements_push = pop @elements_inserts;
    print @elements_push;
}

# Check an array is null or undefined
# A simple way to check if an array is null or defined is to examine it in a scalar
# context to obtain the number of elements in the array. If the array is empty, it
# will return 0, which Perl will also evaluate as boolean false. Bear in mind that
# this is not quite the same thing as undefined, as it is possible to have an empty
# array.

sub check_array_simple {
    my @simple = array_elements_inserts;
    my @context = @simple;
    my @array = @context;

   
    say ("@array\n", "boolean array empty will return 0, quite");
    
 return 0;
